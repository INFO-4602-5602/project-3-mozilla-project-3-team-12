#### Visualization 1: Technology skill level based on geographic location.
This visualization displays a geographical breakdown of users based on how technologically savvy they are. The categories are split into Ultra Nerd, Technically Savvy, Average User, and Luddite. 

**Data**

Our Tech Savvy Index is (per country):

    ((# of Luddite * 1) + (# of Average User * 2) + (# of Technically Savvy * 3) + (# of Ultra Nerd * 4))/(Total # of Participants)

**To Run**

Run `./localServer` and navigate to `Vis1.html`

**Design Process:**

We wanted to see how countries compare against each other based off of participants responses to questions about level of understanding of tech.


#### Visualization 2: Safety and Privacy compared to devices users own.

#### Visualization 3: Technology skill level and perceptions of fear.
This visualization displays how technological skill level impacts users perceptions of fear. The visualization displays each skill level in a different colored cluster of circles. Those clusters show users perceptions of what they fear about losing. The blue cluster represents Average users, orange is Luddite, green is Technically savvy, and red is Ultra nerd. The fears users have are split into five categories of privacy, safety, losing touch, none, and other. The size of the circles represents how many users in that skill level had those fears.

**Data**
To get the data, we manipulated the original datafile and split it based on users biggest fears and who they thought was most resonsible for protecting the online safety, privacy, and security. Those files compared the fear and responsiblity to technology skill level (Ultra Nerd, Technically Savvy, Average User, and Luddite). 
  
**To run**

Run `./localServer` and navigate to `bubble.html`
Roll over bubbles of skill level to see percentages of perceptions of fear.  

**Design Process:** 
Mozilla was interested in understanding how comfortable online users were with technology, and how that impacted things like how tech savvy users were. We visualized how tech savvy users were, and split skill level into perceptions of fear and responsibility. The goal was to see if there was a connection between skill level and perceptions of fear.
