#### Visualization 1: Technology skill level based on geographic location.
This visualization displays a geographical breakdown of users based on how technologically savvy they are. The categories are split into Ultra Nerd, Technically Savvy, Average User, and Luddite. 

**Data**

Our Tech Savvy Index is (per country):

    ((# of Luddite * 1) + (# of Average User * 2) + (# of Technically Savvy * 3) + (# of Ultra Nerd * 4))/(Total # of Participants)

**To Run**

Run `./localServer` and navigate to `Vis1.html`

**Design Process:**

We wanted to see how countries compare against eachother based off of participants responses to questions about level of understanding of tech.



#### Visualization 2: Safety and Privacy compared to devices users own.

**To Run**
**Design Process:**

#### Visualization 3: Technology skill level and perceptions of fear and responsibility.
This visualization displays how technological skill level impacts users perceptions of fear and responsibility. The visualization displays each skill level in a different colored cluster of circles. Those clusters show users perceptions of what they fear and who they think is most respobsible for protecting their online safety, privacy, and security. 

**Data**
To get the data, we manipulated the original datafile and split it based on users biggest fears and who they thought was most resonsible for protecting the online safety, privacy, and security. Those files compared the fear and responsiblity to technology skill level (Ultra Nerd, Technically Savvy, Average User, and Luddite).
